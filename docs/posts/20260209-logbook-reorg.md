# Site updates for 2026

I've given the logbook site a refresh for the new year. To facilitate more frequent sharing of work in progress, I've added a Processing tab with Jupyter notebook integration. We will also advertise and summarize new content (such as beamtime logs) when it is added using blog posts, now available on the main page.

<!-- more -->

Here are the details:

- [Processing](../processing) tab for DIALS and mdx2 workflows, reports, and analysis
- Automatically render jupyter notebooks (via [mkdocs-jupyter](https://github.com/danielfrg/mkdocs-jupyter)), with link to download the source ipynb file. Example: ([processing/20250624_als_mac1/mdx2_mac1_H6](../processing/20250624_als_mac1/mdx2_mac1_H6))
- Moved blog posts to the home page (RIP "Analysis" tab).
- Added DOI link to the header.
