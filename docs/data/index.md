# Diffuse data catalog

A catalog of publicly available diffraction datasets collected for the purpose of diffuse scattering analysis (background images included).

For internal reference, entries linking to public repositories have been assigned an (unofficial) Diffuse Data Bank (DDB) number. If you know of a dataset that we missed, please get in touch!

This list will grow as the diffuse project collects and posts data.
