# 2025-06-24 @ ALS 8.3.1

An impromptu trip to ALS during Astera meeting. We collected diffraction data from several SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 macrodomain crystals at room temperature.

- James, Mehagan, and Steve collected data from 4 macrodomain crystals harvested from a single tray "Plate 1" provided by JF's lab.
- There was some messing around before we got the dose right. So each dataset had different beam properties (divergence & flux).
- The crystals were of moderate size (~ 100 x 200 x 200 Âµm^3)
- We used the usual Ando lab method: MiTeGen plastic sleeves, background measurements.
- We did NOT use a humidity controlled environment for harvesting (not enough time to set it up).

Usable datasets:

file prefix | tray, well | dose rate\* | notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
`H6_5` | tray 1, well H6 | high | 360 degrees, 0.1 deg/frame, spots decayed rapidly (damage)
`H8_8` | tray 1, well H8 | medium | 360 degrees, 0.1 deg/frame, some damage toward the end?
`G8_1` | tray 1, well G8 | low | 360 degrees, 0.1 deg/frame

\*by adjusting attenuators and mirror defocus, need to ask James H how to retrieve this info from metadata file
