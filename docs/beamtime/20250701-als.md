# 2025-07-01 @ ALS 8.3.1

James and Mehagan continued data collection from Galen's macrodomain plate using a variety of mounting methods.

Data path (ALS): `/data/jamesh/diffUSE /data/mehaganh/diffuse`

Dose rate of ~1000 Gy/s @ 1.25% transmission

## James' text notes

Crystals being mounted from Galen's plate
the first six (xtal1-xtal6) were from wells A1 and A2. I tried free-air mounting in paratone-N oil (no sleeve). This didn't work too well.

```

the next two (xtal7-xtal8) Mehagan mounted out of A3. Still in paratone, but using sleeves. These worked better.

next two (xtal9-xtal10) were from well A5. No oil with sleeve. 
Two targets from same crystal. 
Two backgrounds: 
bg_2 at same attenuation as data, but collected from the kapton "neck" of the loop.
bg_3 same, but with no attenuation.

beam drift problem: by end of run: 834.3 Gy/s unattenuated

tuned up to do runs 2 and beyond for xtal12
from here on I am certain about the dose rate being 1 kGy/s for transmission=0.0126
next round was re-visiting the three targets on xtal12

and again, this time unattenuated

target 4 was in between two pre-burned areas (1 and 2), to see impact of nearby rad dam

And, finally, because we were going home, I turned on the cryo stream to start cooling it down as we collected. Target 5 was, again, in between targets 2 and 3.

Next day, collected on two more crystals from well A6. Still under santovac-5 oil,
but cryo-cooled.
