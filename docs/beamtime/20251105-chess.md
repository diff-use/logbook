# 2025-11-05 @ CHESS 7b2

Our fourth CHESS beam time of the 2025-3 run cycle.

## Goals

- Training new members
- Standardize methods across beamlines (Kara visiting)
- Data processing on voltage park (Joseph, Justin visiting)
- Mac1 +/- ADP-ribose
- Continue data collection on NrdE, DNA crystals
- Screen ATCase R-state crystals (PALA, +/- ATP and GTP)
- Test next prototype guard aperture for on-axis camera setup

## Participants

Steve M, Xiaokun P, Katie L, Sarah H, Marcus G, Shaheer K (from Ando lab), Kara Z (from Fraser lab), Joseph L and Justin B (from Astera).

## Data

Root directory at CHESS: `/nfs/chess/raw/2025-3/id7b2/meisburger/20251105`

Root directory on OSN: `s3://diffuse-chess-public/20251105`

## Beamline setup

The beamline setup was similar to 9/24/2025 (no in-line camera, no temperature control).  A new SPEC macro was developed to automatically take crystal images every 30 degrees.

parameter | value | notes
--- | --- | --- 
X-ray energy | 14 keV @ 0.01% bandwidth | Si 111 channel cut mono inserted
Beam size | 100 µm x 100 µm, top-hat profile | Defined using slits, CRL bypassed (toroidal mirror focusing only)
Flux | 5.6 x 10<sup>10</sup> ph/s unattenuated | See station notebook: *Steve Meisburger CHESS notebook #3* p. 52
Background reduction | 300 µm aperture placed close to the sample | The prototype aperture tests were not successful, so we reverted to the default setup.
Centering camera | top-view camera | 1.713 µm / pixel at 4x zoom ratio. A new spec macro was used to automatically save crystal images every 30 degrees.
Beamstop | 700 µm diameter Mo disk suspended on mylar sheet, semi-transparent | At this energy, the bleedthrough was more intense than usual, and there were some faint diffraction rings visible in the image
Data collection software | "MX Collect" (python) & SPEC | The main GUI was the same as last time. A `<prefix>_scan.json` file was created for each data collection. Counter values and motor positions were recorded in a `<prefix>.spec` file. Images in h5 format were generated using Eiger filewriter. 
Temperature control | none | All datasets collected at ambient temperature

Mike C and Zhongwu W created this new version of the on-axis centering mirror with integrated cleanup aperture. Zhongwu drilled a 250 µm hole in tantalum to create an X-ray aperture, and this was epoxied to the end of the Mo tube. During commisioning time, we were able to align the aperture, and it worked as expected (no slit scatter around the beamstop). However, it was apparent from the diffraction images that epoxy had gotten into the aperture hole. Mike C will work on gluing jig and create a new version for our next visit.

## Data collection, day 1

Samples for room temperature data collection were harvested in the humidity chamber (100 % RH). Reusable MiTeGen bases are used with micro RT capillaries cut to length, with 10 µL of well solution in the tip.

With the large number of participants, we sometimes had multiple projects going at once. Note that the following is organized chronologically rather than by project.
<!-- 
### 1. Lysozyme

Steve looped at ~600 µm lysozyme crystal from well B5 of Shaheer's trya using a 500 µm loop, micro RT with 10 µL well solution in the tip. Harvested in humid chamber at ~100% RH.

New directory: `lysozyme/calibration_sample/lys_cal1`

Saved 12 images (full rotation, every 30 degrees), top view, zoom 2.

3616 and 3617 were collected from different locations.

### 2. Mac1 + ADPr

Kara opened well A3 from Katie's Mac1 tray #2. She pipetted 1 µL of 40 mM ADP-ribose (in water). We don't exactly know the drop volume, our target concentration is 20 mM. Kara set a timer for 10 minutes. She loaded 10 µL of well solution in the capillary.

3626 was a vector scan. 

!!! tip "How to estimate dose for vector scans"

    ∆x is the component of translation along the spindle axis. The maximum residence time of a part of the crystal in the beam can be estimated as `(w/∆x)*images*∆t`, where `w` is the beam width (100 µm). Here, 10.35 s.

### 18. ATCase (R)

Steve looped several R-state crystals from well B6 of Sarah's new tray (R-state with PALA, no nucleotides) in a 50 µm loop. The goal here is just to check for diffraction.

Crystals were not visible in the centering camera. Took snapshots at two locations on the loop. 

There were powder-like rings at 3.03 Å and 1.9 Å. Are these salt crystals? Or is the loop dirty?

### 19. ATCase (R)

Steve scooped up a whole mess of crystals from the same drop using a micromesh and blotted from the back with a kimwipe. 

Subdirectory: `R_ATCase/ratc_2`

Took snapshots to check for diffraction. Each snap is a different crystal.

    Realized that the φ0 angle was set incorrectly: given the vertical orientation of the centering camera, I should subtract 90 degrees.

Observed some hits, mostly at ~8 Å resolution. 

!!! question

    Did something go wrong with the grid scan program? Several of the shots contained diffraction from the metal pin. Needs investigation / testing

Taking a few more manual snapshots

!!! success "Done for the night."

    Tomorrow continue with Mac1 + ADPr, ATCase, and DNA

## Data collection, day 2

November 6, 2025.

Kara, Steve, Joseph, & Justin arrived in the morning.

Here's the plan:

- First, collect another Mac1+ADPr dataset at 45 minutes soak time to repeat the earlier ~100% occupancy dataset.
- Next, collect some DNA data from the new tray. Goal is to improve S/N and background subtraction by using larger crystals.
- Collect more crystals of ATCase (RAG) to get a complete (hopefully undamaged) map with good enough S/N for processing.

### 20. Mac1 + ADPr

Kara looped another mac1, and soaked for 45 minutes in a drop containing 9 µL of reservoir solution + 1 µL of ADPr (200 mM).

Datasets 3675 and 3676 are collected from different spots on the crystal.

!!! warning

    The first time I processed this using xia2, the moasicity blew up and it got stuck in integration. Possibly the crystal slipped or cracked during data collection? I repeated processing just on the first 15 degrees. Need to revisit this more carefully.

### 27. ATCase (RAG)

Steve looped a long ATCase (RAG) crystal from Sarah's tray RAG #2 (dated 10/7/2025) well B6. A 200 µm loop was used, but the crystal is *long*, and hit hangs off the end. Strategy is to use a vector scan, and then filter frame ranges by diffraction quality if needed.

### 28. ATCase (RAG)

Steve looped another long RAG crystal from well C1 (same tray). This one is oriented vertically on the loop, so vector scan is not effective. Lets try low dose instead (use attenuation).

Steve opened well C2 of Sarah's RAG tray #2. The right-hand drop has ~5 large single-looking crystals. Katie is attempting to fish them.

!!! warning

    Katie noticed that the drop is staring to dry out. It turned out that the humid box had dropped to 60 % RH --> needed a refresh. This could explain why the last several datasets had poor diffraction. 

### 32. ATCase (RAG)

Refreshed the humid chamber, waited until it reached 100%, then opened well C3. Katie looped a crystal and used a fresh sleeve with 10 µL of well solution.
