# 2025-11-19 @ CHESS 7b2

Our final CHESS beam time of the 2025-3 run cycle.

## Goals

- Screen new crystal hits to prepare for 2026-1
- Test next prototype guard aperture for on-axis camera setup
- Serial datasets on lysozyme, Mac1 (SOS method w/ mylar film)
- Evaluate kapton vs. PET sleeve materials 

## Participants

Steve M, ... (TBD)

## Data

Root directory at CHESS: `/nfs/chess/raw/2025-3/id7b2/meisburger/20251119`

Root directory on OSN: `s3://diffuse-chess-public/20251119`

## Beamline setup

parameter | value | notes
--- | --- | --- 
X-ray energy | 14 keV @ 0.01% bandwidth | Si 111 channel cut mono inserted
Beam size |  | 
Flux |  | 
Background reduction |  | 
Centering camera |  | 
Beamstop | 700 µm diameter Mo disk suspended on mylar sheet, semi-transparent | At this energy, the bleedthrough was more intense than usual, and there were some faint diffraction rings visible in the image
Data collection software | "MX Collect" (python) & SPEC | The main GUI was the same as last time. A `<prefix>_scan.json` file was created for each data collection. Counter values and motor positions were recorded in a `<prefix>.spec` file. Images in h5 format were generated using Eiger filewriter. 
Temperature control | none | All datasets collected at ambient temperature
